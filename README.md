# Function Buildpacks for Knative 

âš¡ Build and deploy your functions fast -- a FaaS experience for HTTP and CloudEvents leveraging buildpacks.

Function Buildpacks for Knative (aka "Functions") brings functions as a programming model, to allow you to quickly build and deploy independent units of logic. Easily handle tasks such as asynchronous event reactions, cloud provider automations, and more. Soon, [func](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/kn-plugin-func) support will allow users to deploy Functions via CLI in a matter of seconds.

## Getting Started

### Building

The buildpacks in this repository have been built, published, and included in the builder. 

The builder is also built and published as an image to `ghcr.io` -- to build an image from source, simply use the builder as shown below.

For example:
```
pack build <image_name> --path /path/to/function --builder ghcr.io/vmware-tanzu/function-buildpacks-for-knative/functions-builder:0.1.0
```

You can get started by working with any of our scaffolded code found in `samples` or `templates` in the root directory.

To learn about local deployment and testing via `curl`, check out [DEPLOYING](DEPLOYING.md).
