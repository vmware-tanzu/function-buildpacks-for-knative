The life of a text file

A long time ago, when I was born into this world.
I was just an empty text file.
I had no content, there was nothing inside me.
Every second I waited for content felt like an eternity.
Finally my day arrived and I was blessed with some content.
I've fulfilled my purpose as an text file.
I'm going to pass all the knowledge I know to my child.
My child, PDF.
My history will live on inside you.
